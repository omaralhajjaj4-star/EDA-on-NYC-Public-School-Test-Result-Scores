There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\nbest_math_schools = (\n    schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640]                 \n    .sort_values(by=['average_math', 'school_name'], ascending=False)  \n    [['school_name', 'average_math']]                     \n)  \n\n\n# Assuming 'total_SAT' is the sum of 'average_math' and 'average_reading' and 'average_writing'\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\n\n# Creating the top_10_schools dataframe\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values(by='total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n\n# Creating the largest_std_dev dataframe\n\nlargest_std_dev = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].std().sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n# Adding the average_SAT row to the dataframe\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.to_frame(name='std_dev')\n\nlargest_std_dev['average_SAT'] = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].mean()\n\n# Adding the std_SAT to the df\n\nlargest_std_dev['std_SAT'] = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].std()\n\n# Adding the num_schools row to the dataframe\n\nlargest_std_dev['num_schools'] = schools.groupby('borough')['school_name'].count()\n\n# Rounding to 2 decimal places and making sure only the top school shows\n\nlargest_std_dev=largest_std_dev.round(2).head(1)\n\nprint(largest_std_dev)\nprint(best_math_schools)","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":56,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\nbest_math_schools = (\n    schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640]                  #
